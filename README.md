Top Japanese Companies Analysis

Introduction

As a practical exercise to enhance my web scraping skills, I utilized Wikipedia as the data source for this project. This is my first completed project, where I analyze top Japanese companies using web scraping with Beautiful Soup, data manipulation with Pandas, and data visualization with Matplotlib. The project aims to extract, clean, and visualize financial data to provide insights into Japan's leading businesses.
